# Hi there! 👋 I’m Paulo Pereira  
🎯 **Senior Android Engineer | Passionate About Scalable, Modern Mobile Solutions**

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m Paulo, a Senior Android Engineer with over **7 years of experience** building apps that are not only functional but also scalable, testable, and fun to use. I’m passionate about modern Android development and love exploring new tools and techniques to create amazing user experiences.  

## 💼 What I Do  
- I specialize in **Android**, **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, and I’m a big fan of modern architecture patterns like **MVVM** and **Clean Architecture**.  
- Writing clean, maintainable, and testable code is my thing! Whether it’s following **SOLID principles** or ensuring quality with **JUnit**, **MockK**, and **Espresso**, I’m all about making code that lasts.  
- I thrive in agile environments, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver great apps and mentor others along the way.  

## 🚀 What I’m Excited About  
Right now, I’m diving into **Kotlin Multiplatform (KMM)** and looking to contribute to open-source projects. I’m always on the lookout for ways to push the boundaries of Android development and make apps even better.

## 🌟 A Project I’m Really Proud Of  
- **JetWeatherfy**: I built this weather app during the **AndroidDevChallenge (Week 4)** by Google, and it was [awarded for **outstanding code quality**](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2021/05/androiddevchallenge-its-wrap.html#:~:text=Code%20quality%3A%20Paulo%20Pereira%20%2D%20JetWeatherfy)! It’s powered by **Jetpack Compose** and demonstrates my commitment to crafting clean and modern Android apps.
